          <h5>Complete Spectrum of Services</h5>

          <br>

          <h5>Independent Advice</h5>
          <p>Testing laboratories and approvals agencies have their strengths and weaknesses in various product areas. Through our sound knowledge of their capabilities and as an independent service provider, Aggarwal Engineering Inc. can recommend the best combination of test facilities and approvals agencies which will give you the best value for your money, and minimize the time to approval. Certification agencies cannot provide design support or solutions for any issues which may arise during the approval process, as an independent agency Aggarwal Engineering works in cooperation with the test laboratories and certification agencies, applying our experience and expertise to resolve any issues and provide support to the manufacturers.</p>
          <br>

          <h5>Standards Development Representation</h5>          
          <p>Aggarwal Engineering Inc. together with their associates retains representation on a number of industry standards development committees, covering a wide range of standards in the areas of product safety and electromagnetic compatibility especially in the areas of alternative energy and electric vehicles. Because of the membership in standard development committees we are in the best position to know the upcoming requirements, know the background of requirements and to interpret the “gray areas” of the standards.</p>

          <p>No matter where you are located, we can provide direct integrated service for all your projects either as a remote resource of support or as an integrated member of your project team.

We are well experienced from large multinationals to small start up operations and therefore well positioned to advise the best cost effective process.</p>
          <br>

          <h5>Cost Effective</h5>          
          <p>Most of the times, our services pay for themselves due to reduced cost from certification agencies as we perform lots of the work for them making their job easy. We are able to negotiate better cost, co-ordinate better time schedules so that you receive better value for your dollar.</p>

          <p>By working with the client during the concept and design cycle, we can perform pre –compliance construction review and evaluations at much lower cost than the certification agencies. This also helps to significantly reduce the risk of failure during the formal testing and certification process.</p>
